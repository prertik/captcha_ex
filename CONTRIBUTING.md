## Development and testing

To set up the development environment you would have to follow several steps:

0. setup `elixir`, we are using the latest release, but supporting everything from `1.2`
1. clone the repo
2. `mix deps.get && mix compile`

To test if everything is working:

1. `mix test` will run unit-tests
2. `mix credo --strict` will run linting
3. `mix dialyzer` will run static analyzer tool to check that everything is fine with your code. It may take some time at the first run

If everything is fine - feel free to submit your code!
